# Balloon Camp Crew Optimiser

This repository provides a solver for planning **balloon camp crew assignments**
using [OR-Tools CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization).
It contains two main solvers:

1. **Vehicle Group Solver** ‚Äì assigns cars to balloon clusters.
2. **Flight Leg Solver** ‚Äì assigns participants and counselors to balloons and cars for a single flight leg.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Hard constraints**
  - Exactly one qualified operator per occupied vehicle.
  - Every passenger (including operator) occupies a seat.
  - Vehicle seat capacity and optional weight limits.
  - Each person appears in ‚â§ 1 vehicle and operates ‚â§ 1 vehicle.
  - Frozen assignments can be enforced.
  - Second-leg ‚Äústay in cluster‚Äù restrictions.
  - Language compatibility checks for balloons.

- **Soft objectives (tunable weights)**
  - Pilot airtime fairness.
  - Passenger airtime fairness.
  - Mixed nationalities within vehicles.
  - Vehicle rotation (discourage repeating the same vehicle).
  - Avoid exactly one participant alone in a car.
  - Passenger balance across ground clusters.
  - Look-ahead terms for multi-leg planning (low-flight passengers, overweight avoidance).
  - Random tie-break fairness.

## üì¶ Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd solver
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies (see [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)):

- `ortools==9.14.6206` ‚Äì CP-SAT solver
- `pytest==8.3.5` ‚Äì testing framework

## üöÄ Usage

The entry point is [`solver_main.py`](solver_main.py).
It reads a JSON object from **stdin** and writes the result to **stdout**.

### CLI

```bash
# Solve vehicle groups
cat input.json | python solver_main.py --mode solve_groups

# Solve a flight leg
cat input.json | python solver_main.py --mode solve_leg
```

- On **success**: writes a manifest JSON and exits with code `0`.
- On **error**: writes an error JSON to stderr and exits with code `1` or `2`.

### CLI Options

| Flag           | Description                                       | Default |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--mode`       | `solve_groups` or `solve_leg`                     | ‚Äì       |
| `--seed`       | Random seed for deterministic shuffles and solver | `42`    |
| `--workers`    | Number of CP-SAT threads                          | `8`     |
| `--time-limit` | Maximum solver runtime in seconds                 | `20`    |
